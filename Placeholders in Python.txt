# ### Placeholders in Python
# 
# What is a Placeholder?
# 
# - Intuitively, a placeholder is a pre-formatted container into which content can be placed.
# - If you have a variable in Python or any other type of data type, you can create a placeholder, usually in a print function to reserve a spot for this variable before explicitly saying what the variable is.

MovieName = "Baahubali"
Ntimes = 4
place = "Theatre"
print("I have watched {} movie {} times in {}".format(MovieName,Ntimes,place))


# In[1]:


name = "Aravind"
age = 36
print("My name is {} and my age is {}".format(name,age))


# ####  Formatting Strings

# In[12]:


name = "Aravind"
age = 36
print("My name is %s and my age is %d" % (name,age))
